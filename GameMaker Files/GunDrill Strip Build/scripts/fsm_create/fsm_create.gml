/*

This is a function for when I start to create
more advanced state machines. 

They'll work under the prefix 'fsm_', and will
have several functions to add/delete states, 
change states, and so on.

This'll be important for objects with several
state machines, so that a simple prefix for
'main'/'gun'/'jetpack'/etc. can be used to
affect the correct state machine

Each FSM created will have a name (used for
finding the correct FSM in each function),
a timer, and a state list.
