The Plan
--------

So, I eventually want to come back to GunDrill. Ideally what I want to happen is for me to balance out the
basics in the design I don't think quite work, add content (lots of levels and enemies), polish it as much
as possible without overstepping the scope, and then release it for free on itch.io or something.

To do this I think there are definitely some things to be addressed. I need a plan.

First of all I'm just going to throw out some general design concerns:
- The movement is still a bit questionable. The mechanics don't feel connected enough.
- Project is bloated. I wanna start fresh but re-use assets/scripts

I wonder if perhaps I should prototype a mini gundrill thing just to test this movement stuff works.
I could use it as a platform to really test the base game, and create lots of levels.

On the subject of the control, some thoughts:
- Lack of connection
- Maybe make everything related to shooting in directions for movement
- If we do this it'd be cohesive, though it might sort of nullify the point of the jetpack
- If shooting is used for movement, I think a clip should be used
- One possible control scheme would be to have 8-directional shooting, and fixed directions for each
- Another would be (and this one makes sense since top-aimed shooting wouldn't really be used for mobile 
stuff) to have the A button trigger downwards shooting, and the direction to change based on movement
(moving left aims the gun right-down, and moving right aims the gun left-down)



I want to explore the last-mentioned control scheme a bit:
- 8 directions
- Left to up to right are normal shooting (X to shoot)
- Down-left to down-right are movement shooting (A to shoot)
- Drill-shoot still exists, with both buttons
